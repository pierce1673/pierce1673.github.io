:::::::::::::ABOUT:::::::::::::

Nighthawk's Kitchen is a comfort food rest stop.

All of the food made in Nighthawk's Kitchen is made from scratch and with love, using fresh meat and produce.  Every product is handmade from the fresh breakfast sausage and the hickory smoked all beef hot dogs, to the BBQ sauce and sweet potato biscuits.  We feature some classic, creative breakfast and lunch menu items and a variety of prepared sauces and canned products.

The Troy Waterfront Farmer's Market is our home base, but we're excited to spread our wings and be a part of other communities and catered events.  We're just getting started so keep an eye out for some surprises as the summer kicks into full gear.
